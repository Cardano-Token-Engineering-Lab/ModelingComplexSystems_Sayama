# Introduction and Foundations of Modeling

## Complex Systems
Complex systems is a rather ambiguous term, but it is to describe a system that has many variables that can be interdependent of each other.  In short, it's hard to simply describe these systems because of the relationships that may exists between all the different variables and actors in the system.

## Modeling
Modeling can be described and broken into two primary classes, descriptive and rule-based modeling.  They differ in the way that they are defined and constructed, ie statistics vs rules.

### Descriptive Modeling
Descriptive modeling is an approach to 'describe' a system by establishing observations of behavior in a system and using the data to infer what the system would do given certain inputs.  Quantative methods, such as regression analysis or pattern recognition are two methodologies that can be done to effective describe 'what the system looks like'.

### Rule-Based Modeling
This form of modeling is usually derived from theoretical methods, where predictions of how the will system will change over time are done and what rules did the system follow.  The main emphasis of rule-based modeling is trying to capture 'how the system will behave'.
