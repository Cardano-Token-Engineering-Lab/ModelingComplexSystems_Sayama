# Introduction to Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems by Hiroki Sayama

This repo will go through a high level review of the book by Hiroki Sayama and will be used to help teach some of the modeling and analytics that can be utilized to model more complex systems like token design and incentive design mechanisms. These core skills will be the heart of developing models to help understand the factors at play in these dynamic and complex systems.

This repo will go through some high level explanation and demonstration of the topics in the book to help prime and understand why modeling complex systems is important and to build the basics behind the methodology of building a model.
