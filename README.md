This repo will go through a high level review of the book by Hiroki Sayama and will be used to help teach some of the modeling and analytics that can be utilized to model more complex systems like token design and incentive design mechanisms. These core skills will be the heart of developing models to help understand the factors at play in these dynamic and complex systems.
